Project: Recreate the board game Risk allowing users to play a standard game with either human or AI opponents. 

Project Description: We created the board game Risk with a focus on visuals, button implementation, and the ability to play against AI opponents. Players can play through a classic game of Risk with some limitations. For example, the Risk typically introduces a neutral third player for two player games that we have decided to leave out. We also do not strongly enforce the order of actions that can be taken during a turn, but players can perform the normal actions of a turn such as fortifying territories, attacking territories, trading in risk cards, and moving armies between territories. The player can play through the game and ultimately become victorious.

Running our program: We recommend utilizing a clean and build function before running our program. Our main program is located in the RiskView.java file in the default package. When running the program multiple times for testing, it is best to set up a game with 6 total players and 5 AI players as it requires the least amount of clicking to set up the board and progress into the main phase of the game.
